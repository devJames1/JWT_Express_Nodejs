# JWT Authentication with Express.js and Node.js

This repository provides a guide and example code for implementing JWT (JSON Web Token) authentication in a Node.js and Express.js application.

## Prerequisites

To get started, ensure that you have the following installed on your system:

- Node.js
- NPM (Node Package Manager)

## Installation

1. Clone this repository to your local machine or download the source code as a ZIP file.

2. Open a terminal or command prompt and navigate to the project directory.

3. Run the following command to install the required dependencies: `npm install`

## Usage

1. After installing the dependencies, open the `index.js` file in your preferred code editor.

2. Explore the example code provided in the repository to understand how to configure JWT authentication middleware, handle user registration and login, and protect routes using JWT.

3. Customize the code as per your application's requirements, such as integrating with a database for user management.

4. Run the following command to start the server: `node index.js` This will start the server, and it will be accessible at `http://localhost:8000`.

5. Use a tool like Postman(recommended) or cURL to send HTTP requests to test the authentication endpoints and protected routes.
